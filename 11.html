    <h4>To Kill a Mockingbird</h4>
    <p>This book cover is one of many given to Harper Lee's classic work <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> (1960). The novel won a<br> Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and the next year was made into an Academy Award-winning film.</p>

    <p><strong>Harper Lee</strong>, believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed,<br> famously published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was<br> published in 2015 just before her death). Lee’s <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> was published in<br> 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in<br> the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named<br> Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and<br> just lawyer and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives<br> in the United States at a time when tensions regarding race were high. <em>To Kill a<br> Mockingbird</em> earned the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 and was made into an<br> Academy Award-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters further life<br> and influence over the American social sphere.</p>
