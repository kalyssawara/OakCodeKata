    <blockquote>“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square
        holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status
        quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore
        them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy
        ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones
        who do.”
